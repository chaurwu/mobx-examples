Data and presentation are separated.
This example uses mobx-state tree to define the data model in store.js.
Presentation is decomposed into multiple components.
Those components are in App.js, display.js and input.js.

Data is passed to components via mobx-react Provider.

I create the project by coping the files from mobx-examples/a3.
